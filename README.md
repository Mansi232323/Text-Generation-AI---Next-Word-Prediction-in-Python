*Text Generation AI - Next Word Prediction in Python*
This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates how to predict the next word in a given text sequence using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The model is trained on a sequence of words to learn the context and predict the most likely next word in the sequence.

*Features

Tokenizes text using regular expressions.
Creates input and output sequences for training.
Builds and trains an LSTM model using Keras.
Predicts the next word in a given text sequence.

Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
nltk
